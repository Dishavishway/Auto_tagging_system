# Auto Tagging System

## Overview
The **Auto Tagging System** is a machine learning-based project that automatically predicts relevant tags based on a given input string, such as a comment or question. This can be helpful in contexts like forums or Q&A platforms to auto-assign tags to content.

## Features
- Predicts relevant tags based on input text.
- Utilizes string matching, machine learning concepts, and regular expressions for tag prediction.
- Handles large datasets of questions, answers, and tags using `pandas`.
- Visualizes data with `matplotlib`.

## Prerequisites
To run the project, you need the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `re` (Regular Expressions)
- `BeautifulSoup` (for HTML data handling)

You can install the required Python packages with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib beautifulsoup4
